# Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This is the course project/assignment for the Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data course.
The "run_analysis.R" script does the following:

1. Import two (2) libraries - "data.table" and "plyr".
2. Load all the related data into variables.
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
6. Creates a tidy dataset (tidydata.txt) that consists of the average value of each variable which depends on subject and activity.

### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
